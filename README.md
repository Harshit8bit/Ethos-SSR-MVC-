**Ethos** is a feature-rich web application inspired by Airbnb, designed to allow users to discover, list, and review unique places to stay. This project is a full-stack MERN application (using EJS for the frontend) that demonstrates a wide range of web development skills, including user authentication, third-party API integration, and cloud-based file management.

## 🚀 Core Features

* **Full CRUD Functionality:** Users can create, read, update, and delete their own listings.
* **User Authentication:** Secure user sign-up, login, and logout functionality using Passport.js.
* **Interactive Maps:** Utilizes the **Mapbox API** to:
    * Display a cluster map of all listings on the index page.
    * Show a dynamic, interactive map for each listing's location on the show page.
* **Cloud Image Uploads:** Integrates with **Cloudinary** for seamless image uploads. All listing images are stored in the cloud, not on the server.
* **Reviews & Ratings:** Authenticated users can post and delete reviews (with star ratings) for listings.
* **Flash Messages:** Provides pop-up "flash" messages for user feedback (e.g., "Listing created successfully!", "Please log in first.").
* **Responsive Design:** Built with Bootstrap and custom CSS for a mobile-first, responsive user experience.
* **Schema & Data Validation:** Uses Joi and Mongoose for robust server-side and database-level data validation.
